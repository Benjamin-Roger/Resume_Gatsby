I make and modernize business websites and web apps.

Former project manager and IT consultant, I know your expectations and frustrations in IT projects on both sides, business and technical, as I've done both. I make applications tailored to your business needs.

This website is made with Gatsby, ReactJS and GraphQL. Find its code [here](https://github.com/Benjamin-Roger/gatsby-resume/)!

**A project ? You are in the right place!**
